In the end, he inputs his data and receives confirmation of order on screen.

Rudimental version of Beerhouse in Dutch, created with JDBC

Technical requirements:
IDE with Spring installed
MySql database (by Oracle)

Important: I did not supply the database because this is not mine. You can, however, recreate database based on the inputs (if you want to take the code).
